I am a Computer Science student and systems enthusiast passionate about building innovative solutions across development and operations. Currently focused on developing a Docker implementation from scratch to better understand containerization's role in software delivery lifecycle. My interests span cloud-native technologies, infrastructure automation, and operational aspects of system design, with a growing focus on deployment strategies and reliability patterns in distributed environments.

## üöÄ About Me
- üê≥ Currently building a Docker implementation from scratch as part of my [mydocker](https://github.com/dhruvmistry2000/mydocker) project, which complements my work on [mykubernetes](https://github.com/dhruvmistry2000/mykubernetes) by providing a foundational container runtime.
- ‚ò∏Ô∏è Passionate about Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies 
- üêß Arch Linux enthusiast and open source contributor
- ‚å®Ô∏è Terminal power user with a customized development workflow
- üõ†Ô∏è Love experimenting with system customization and automation

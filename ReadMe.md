# 👋 Hi there! I'm Dhruv Mistry

I'm a Computer Science student and systems enthusiast with a passion for building from the ground up. My current focus is on developing a Docker implementation from scratch, which has deepened my understanding of container technologies and Linux internals. I enjoy working with cloud-native technologies, system customization, and automation tools. I'm also interested in exploring more about distributed systems and cloud architecture patterns.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🐳 Currently building a Docker implementation from scratch as part of my [mydocker](https://github.com/dhruvmistry2000/mydocker) project, which complements my work on [mykubernetes](https://github.com/dhruvmistry2000/mykubernetes) by providing a foundational container runtime.
- ☸️ Passionate about Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies 
- 🐧 Arch Linux enthusiast and open source contributor
- ⌨️ Terminal power user with a customized development workflow
- 🛠️ Love experimenting with system customization and automation
